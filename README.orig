munin_ipmi_plugins
------------------

This is simply a python rewrite of the ipmi_sensor_ writen in Ruby by Peter Palfrader. 




Reason
------

We had a machine that was very long to run the full "ipmitool -I open " so we had to modify the
way the plugin was working. We prefer python, so a quick rewrite was done. 

Improvements
------------

The full on ipmitool command is only run on suggests, then a specific get is run everytime 
munin-node is done. 

The Ruby version can be found here :
